          Donating leftover clothes is a simple yet impactful way to help those
          in need. Our platform connects generous donors with local
          organizations and individuals who can make use of gently used
          clothing. By donating, you’re not only reducing textile waste but also
          making a meaningful difference in someone’s life. Whether you have
          extra clothes you no longer need, or gently worn items that could
          benefit others, we’re here to facilitate the donation process,
          ensuring it reaches those who will benefit. Together, we can create a
          community of kindness and care, one piece of clothing at a time.

      <h2>Current Scenario</h2>
      <div class="explanation">
        <p>
          On average, an Indian household discards a significant amount of
          usable clothing each year, contributing to growing textile waste and
          environmental strain. At the same time, countless individuals across
          the country lack access to basic clothing, highlighting a stark
          imbalance in resource distribution. The lack of awareness, fast
          fashion habits, and limited donation channels further worsen the
          problem. To tackle clothing waste, India needs stronger initiatives,
          public awareness campaigns, and better infrastructure for collection
          and redistribution. By embracing sustainable clothing practices and
          donating unused garments, we can significantly reduce waste and bring
          dignity to those in need.
